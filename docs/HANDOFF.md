# mygpt Handoff

## Start here

1. Read Drive root `全项目` and all current `全项目_*` baselines.
2. Read exact-target-branch `SECURITY_POLICY.md` and `AGENTS.md`.
3. Read `governance/project_state.json`.
4. Read North Star, Architecture Invariants, Current State, Decision Ledger, Evaluation Ledger, artifact manifest, pending sync, and Pre-flight Checklist.
5. Restore Book / StudyMate / ChatContextVault state from their own repositories only when needed.

Repository evidence outranks chat recollection.

## Current recovery point

This repository has just completed its initial project-foundation synchronization on a non-default branch.

No application code exists yet.

The central architectural decision is:

`Book First → OS Sensor Second → User Context Third → Screen Vision Last`

The first engineering milestone is a small Book-to-mygpt semantic event contract, not full-device screen surveillance.

## Current product concept

mygpt should feel like a person who is present:
- usually quiet when the user is studying well;
- able to teach using current Book context;
- able to notice meaningful departures or likely distraction;
- able to ask whether the user is stuck rather than making brittle assumptions;
- able to switch naturally between learning, encouragement, ordinary conversation, and emotional support.

Shadow mode is optional and explicitly simulated.

## Next step

Produce the v0.1 interface/spec for:
- Book StudyContext snapshot;
- Book StudyEvent stream;
- Companion intervention state;
- local session state and privacy gates;
- minimal communication path between Book and mygpt.

Do not implement continuous screen capture before proving that Book semantic context plus low-cost device signals are insufficient.
